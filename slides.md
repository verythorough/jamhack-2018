## What can functions do?

- authenticated API calls from the frontend
- webhook listeners & event-driven workflows
- chatbots & voice apps (Alexa, Google Home)
- all your awesome hackathon ideas!

---

## Add to your repo

In the UI

![](/img/functions-folder.png)

---

## Add to your repo

With a `netlify.toml` file

```
[build]
  Functions = "lambda"
```

---

## Get an endpoint

```
/.netlify/functions/<your-function-name>
```

Look, Mom, no CORS!

---

## Building Netlify Functions

---

## The Basic

Add a plain JS file to your functions folder

```
exports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {
    callback(null, {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: "Hello, World"
    });
}
```

The filename becomes the function endpoint:

```
`hello.js` ‚û°Ô∏è `/.netlify/functions/hello`
```

---

## [netlify-lambda](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/#netlify-lambda-cli)

A handy library that:

- Adds webpack and Babel
- Runs a local function server for development
- Builds your functions to single files in the functions folder

---

## [netlify-lambda](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/#netlify-lambda-cli)

Add to your project:

1. Install it with `npm install netlify-lambda`.
2. Include a `netlify.toml` file with the location of your [functions folder](#configuring-the-functions-folder).
3. Put the source files in a *different* folder.

- a premade `netlify.toml` file to set the functions folder

---

## [Create React App Lambda](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/#create-react-app-lambda)

![](/img/variables.png)

---

## Environment Variables

- Save in a local `.env` file (but don't push it to GitHub!)
- Use `dotenv` to include the variables in your code

```
const SECRET_API_KEY = process.env.SECRET_API_KEY;
```

---

## Environment Variables

- Pass API calls through your function without exposing your key!
