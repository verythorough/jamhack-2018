## What can functions do?

- authenticated API calls from the frontend
- webhook listeners & event-driven workflows
- chatbots & voice apps (Alexa, Google Home)
- all your awesome hackathon ideas!

---

## Add to your repo

In the UI

![](/img/functions-folder.png)

---

## Add to your repo

With a `netlify.toml` file

```
[build]
  Functions = "lambda"
```

---

## Get an endpoint

```
/.netlify/functions/<your-function-name>
```

Look, Mom, no CORS!

---

## Building Netlify Functions

---

## The Basic

Add a plain JS file to your functions folder

```
exports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {
    callback(null, {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: "Hello, World"
    });
}
```

The filename becomes the function endpoint:

```
`hello.js` ‚û°Ô∏è `/.netlify/functions/hello`
```

---

## [netlify-lambda](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/#netlify-lambda-cli)

A handy library that:

- Adds webpack and Babel
- Runs a local function server for development
- Builds your functions to single files in the functions folder

---

## [netlify-lambda](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/#netlify-lambda-cli)

Add to your project:

1. Install it with `npm install netlify-lambda`.
2. Include a `netlify.toml` file with the location of your [functions folder](#configuring-the-functions-folder).
3. Put the source files in a *different* folder.

---

## Environment Variables

Save in the Netlify UI

![](/img/variables.png)

---

## Environment Variables

- Save in a local `.env` file (but don't push it to GitHub!)
- Use `dotenv` to include the variables in your code

```
const SECRET_API_KEY = process.env.SECRET_API_KEY;
```

---

## Environment Variables

Make API calls without exposing your key!

```
// Send greeting to Slack
  return fetch(process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, {
    headers: {
      "content-type": "application/json"
    },
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({ text: `${name} says hello!` })
  })
    .then(() => ({
      statusCode: 200,
      body: `Hello, ${name}! Your greeting has been sent to Slack üëã`
    }))
    .catch(error => ({
      statusCode: 422,
      body: `Oops! Something went wrong. ${error}`
    }));
};
```

## Examples to Get You Started

[Netlify Function Example](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-functions-example) [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/biilmann/create-react-app-lambda)

- Framework-free setup with netlify-lambda
- [Demo site and guide](https://functions-playground.netlify.com/) with sample functions from basic to powerful
- Lots more example repos in the README

---

## Features in Both Examples

- a `src/lambda` folder for storing your functions source files
- a premade `netlify.toml` file to set the functions folder
- built-in proxy redirect for local dev

```
 `/.netlify/functions/hello` Ô∏è ‚û°Ô∏è `http://localhost:9000/hello`
```
